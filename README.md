# GSoC'24

Hi, Iâ€™m Kushagra Sharma, a GSoC 2024 contributor for Mozilla Firefox. This year, my project has focused on enhancing Firefox's print dialog by adding support for Common Print Dialog Backends (CPDB), aimed at providing seamless print integration on Linux. Here's a brief project report.

## Mozilla Print dialog Project Overview

### Goals

The primary goal of my project is to integrate CPDB support into the Firefox print dialog. By doing so, users will benefit from a more consistent and reliable printing experience across various printers and operating systems. The CPDB will act as an intermediary, facilitating communication between the print dialog and diverse printing services, which is crucial for a seamless user experience.

### Background

CPDB is designed to simplify the development of print backends and ensure compatibility across multiple platforms. The integration of CPDB into Firefox will not only bring uniformity to the printing process but also enable new features that can be leveraged by developers and users alike.

## Progress Update

### 1. Development Environment Setup

I successfully configured the Mozilla build environment, ensuring that I have the necessary tools and dependencies to work on the project. This included:

- Cloning the Firefox repository and setting up Mercurial (hg) for version control.
- Installing build dependencies and configuring `mach`, Mozilla's build system, to compile the Firefox source code.

### 2. Implementation of CPDB Support

#### Initial Steps

- I began the implementation by reviewing existing print backends in Firefox, focusing on how they interact with the print dialog.
- Created a series of dummy printer instances to simulate the presence of actual printers, allowing for initial testing of the print dialog's integration with CPDB.
- **Core Functionality**:
  - `nsPrinterBase`: This class provides the base functionality needed for printer operations. It defines the essential methods that any print backend must implement, such as initializing print settings, retrieving printer capabilities, and managing print jobs.
  - `nsPrinterListBase`: This class serves as a list manager for printers, handling the collection of available printers and facilitating the selection of specific printers for printing tasks. It lays the groundwork for integrating various printer backends by providing a unified interface.

  
#### Integration Challenges

While implementing CPDB support, I encountered several challenges:

- **Understanding the Print Dialog Architecture**: The existing print dialog structure in Firefox was complex, requiring a deep dive into the codebase to understand how to extend it for CPDB support.
- **Build Configuration Issues**: Setting up the build flags and ensuring the CPDB library was correctly linked in the build process took considerable time and effort.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Managing data types between C and C++ within the CPDB interface posed additional complications. This required close attention to detail and frequent testing to ensure compatibility.

#### Ongoing Work

Currently, I am focusing on refining the integration by:

- Implementing additional features from the CPDB API, ensuring that the print dialog can dynamically fetch printer properties and settings.
- Conducting thorough tests to verify that the dummy printers are recognized correctly and that their properties are displayed accurately in the print dialog.

### 3. Upstream Contributions

initial implementation is stable, I have to submitted a work in progress code review request to the Mozilla repository. This will allow other developers to review my work, provide feedback, and facilitate collaboration on further enhancements. The goal is to ensure that the CPDB support is robust and adheres to Mozilla's code quality standards.

### 4. Demonstration of Functionality

As I progress, I will adding code reviews and merge request showcasing the functionality of the CPDB print backend within Firefox. This will include:

- An overview of the print dialog with CPDB integration.
- Highlighting the differences in user experience before and after implementing CPDB support.

## Monthly Reports

To maintain transparency and keep the community updated, I plan to document my progress through monthly reports. These will detail my achievements, challenges faced, and any adjustments made to the project timeline.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to:

- **The Mozilla Development Community**: Their ongoing support and resources have been essential in guiding my work.
- **Mentors and Contributors**: Special thanks to those who have provided constructive feedback and shared their expertise, which has been instrumental in overcoming obstacles.
- **OpenPrinting Team**: For laying the groundwork with CPDB, making my current project possible.

I'm excited about the potential of this project and am committed to delivering a meaningful enhancement to Mozilla Firefox's printing capabilities as part of GSoC 2024.
